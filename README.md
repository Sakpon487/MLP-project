## MLP project

Code and experiments for the MLP final project.

### Clone

From a **valid directory** (e.g. your home or Desktop — avoid cloning from a path that no longer exists):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sakpon487/MLP-project.git
cd MLP-project
```

If you see `getcwd: cannot access parent directories`, run `cd ~` (or another existing folder) first, then clone.

### Structure
- `open_clip/`: CLIP training/inference utilities and related code.
